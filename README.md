# JATA - Just Another Todo App

A todo app built with React + Redux.


## Demo

To get the project, clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/OldTownIT/just-another-todo-app.git
```

## Pre-requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

You will need node version `16.14.1`

This version of node is a few years old. You can use nvm to manage various versions.

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

[Installing nvm on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows#install-nvm-windows-nodejs-and-npm)


You will get better results if you first **REMOVE** all versions of node, and then install NVM, and then let NVM install specific versions that you want.

```
nvm list
nvm install 16.14.1
nvm use 16.14.1
```


## Installing the app

CD into the directory where you installed the todo app.  And then run:

```bash
npm install
```

And then, to run the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

If it runs successfully, it will start a server and run the app.
